#+title: FreeRTOS in Keil, a Kata
#+author: K. Naqvi
#+date: [2025-03-11 Tue]

Here we'll set up a simple application to run
- on f103rb
- using Keil, armclang
- will add FreeRTOS later

* Development notes
** starting with nothing
- coding a simple blinky program from scratch
  - using C++ and C
  - targeting nucleo-f103rb
  - using Keil with armclang (6.13)
  - incorporating freertos (10.5)
  - here's a link to the freertos-f103rb project I'll use during the
    lectures <fill this in>

** restructure code, add skeletal files
Now I'll make a directory structure to hold my application code.
#+begin_src bash :results none
  mkdir -p ense481-kata2/code/app/include
#+end_src

And now I'll create all the source files, in an empty state.
#+begin_src bash :results none
  touch ense481-kata2/code/app/include/FreeRTOSConfig.h
  touch ense481-kata2/code/Makefile
#+end_src

I also want to incorporate freertos, via a symlink.  I've installed
v10.5.1 on my system under =~/VBS/FreeRTOS-LTS=
: ../../FreeRTOS-LTS
and the link is to reside as a sibling to =code=, so it must be placed
under =kata1/code=.
#+begin_src bash :dir ense481-kata2/code :results none
  ln -s ~/VBS/FreeRTOS-LTS/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/ FreeRTOS-Kernel
#+end_src

** Add some content
Next I'd like to fill in my empty source files, with prebuilt content.

First a Makefile that builds an emacs tags database for freertos.
/Note to self/: To generate this file, use the key sequence =C-u C-c
C-v t= with point inside the block.
#+begin_src makefile :tangle kata1/code/Makefile  :results none
INC := app/include FreeRTOS-Kernel/include
INC += FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3

tags :
	etags app/*.cpp app/include/*.h FreeRTOS-Kernel/*.c \
           FreeRTOS-Kernel/include/*.h \
           FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/*.[ch]

mostlyclean :
clean : mostlyclean
	rm -f TAGS
#+end_src

The primary source file is =main.cpp=

#+begin_src bash :results none
cat <<EOF > ense481-kata2/code/app/main.cpp
/** A simple app, to demonstrate freertos */

/* standard includes */

/* freertos includes */
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "task.h"

/* HW-specific includes (move to bsp area) */
#include "stm32f10x.h"

int main() {
    
}
EOF
#+end_src

Add the .gitignore file at the top (git root)

#+begin_src bash :results none
cat <<EOF > .gitignore
# ignore emacs backups
*~
EOF
#+end_src

Add a sub .gitignore file in the Keil proj dir
#+begin_src bash :results none
cat <<EOF > ense481-kata2/.gitignore
# ignore emacs backups
*~
# ignore tags file generated by 'etags' in Makefile
/code/TAGS

# ignore uvision-generated files
code/Listings/
code/Objects/
*.uvguix.*
/*.uvoptx

# ignore symlink to freertos: I'm not tracking this
# and anyway I've made it all read-only
/code/FreeRTOS-Kernel
EOF
#+end_src

We also need a FreeRTOSConfig.h.  This file is considered to be part
of the user code so I'm putting it under the =app/include=
directory.

#+begin_src bash :results none
cat <<EOF > ense481-kata2/code/app/include/FreeRTOSConfig.h

The above include file sets the heap size to 2kiB.  I have decided to
use the =heap_4.c= manager.  Note: this link to [[https://www.freertos.org/a00110.html][FreeRTOSConfig.h]]
describes every possible entry and is an essential online reference.

** From within the Keil system:
*** Create a Keil project
- named =kata2=
- place it under the git root, in the directory =./ense481-kata2/
- during the Keil configuration we
  - selected our chip: the stm32f103rb
  - added packages =CMSIS CORE= and =Device Startup=

*** Change the Keil debugger setting
- by default Keil chooses the *ulink2* debug probe (this is used with
  the ball-height controller board: the MCBSTM32EXL)
- we must change it to the *stlink* for the f103rb nucleo board

*** Add all the C and C++ source files to Keil
- change =Source Group 1= to the more meaningful name =main=
- create a new source group for FreeRTOS: =freertos-gcc-arm-cm3=
- add freertos C source files under =code/FreeRTOS-Kernel/=:
  - =event_groups.c=
  - =list.c=
  - =queue.c=
  - =stream_buffer.c=
  - =tasks.c=
  - =timers.c=
  - (I skipped =croutine.c=)
  - =portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/port.c=
  - =portable/MemMang/heap_4.c=
- in Keil do a *save all* so the .uvprojx file is updated

*** Tell Keil where to find all include files
The paths to search for includes are specified relative to the *Keil
Project* root (which is different from the *git root*).  That is, the
Keil project root is in this subdir =./ense481-kata2/=, so we set up
the following paths
- =./app/include=
- =./FreeRTOS-Kernel/include=
- =./FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3=

This can be done ``globally'' at the top Keil level =Target 1= which I
did *not* bother to rename.  (You will configure this under the
=C/C++= tab.  Use the *Include Paths* dialog.)

*** Set freertos-specific options
Keil options can be specified at any directory level in the project,
and the settings will apply only to that subdirectory.  This is
particularly useful in my case, because I want to compile my code with
the most extreme warnings enabled, but I want to compile the FreeRTOS
code with reduced warnings (also FreeRTOS is a C project).

In Keil, select the source group =freertos-gcc-arm-cm3=, and select
the *Options for Target* wizard, select the *C/C++ AC6* tab.

This is currently set to the ``Arm Compiler 6 (AC6)'' settings, but we
want to enable the /old/ ``Arm Compiler 5'' (AC5-like) warnings.
These warnings are much less stringent, and will allow FreeRTOS to be
compiled with no flood of warnings which in any case we cannot fix.

*** Do a build with the trivial main.cpp
Now our code builds with no warnings or errors, and just for the
record here are the sizes:
: Program Size: Code=716 RO-data=252 RW-data=0 ZI-data=1752
This means that this system with an *empty* main uses 716+252+0=968
bytes of flash, and 1752 bytes of RAM (plus other RAM entities like
stack usage)

** start using freertos features: tasks
Make the body of main into a task and call =xTaskCreate= on that task,
without starting the scheduler.
- extract contents of main(), place in a function with this signature
  : void blinkPA5(void * blah);
- replace body of main()
#+begin_src C++
void blinkPA5(void * blah) {
    // turn on clock for GPIOA
    ,*((uint32_t volatile *)0x40021018) |= 4;

    // configure PA5 to be output, push-pull, 50MHz
    ,*((uint32_t volatile *)(0x40010800 + 0)) = 0x44344444;

    while (1) {
        // turn on PA5 LED
        ,*((uint32_t volatile *)(0x40010800 + 0xc)) |=  1u<<5;
        for (int volatile counter = 0; counter < 1000000; ++counter) { }

        // turn off PA5 LED
        ,*((uint32_t volatile *)(0x40010800 + 0xc)) &= ~(1u<<5);
        for (int volatile counter = 0; counter < 1000000/2; ++counter) { }
    }
}
int main() {
    BaseType_t retval = xTaskCreate(
        blinkPA5,    // task function
        "my blinky", // task name
        50,          // stack in words
        nullptr,     // optional parameter
        4,           // priority
        nullptr      // optional out: task handle
        );
    configASSERT(retval==pdPASS);

    //blinkPA5(nullptr);  // will not return
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    // deadloop in case we fall through
    while (1) {}
}
#+end_src

** Making freertos work with the Keil startup code

Simply calling =vTaskStartScheduler()= causes a lockup because the
Keil-supplied startup code defines most exceptions as simply
'jump-to-self'.  FreeRTOS, in contrast, expects three exceptions to be
implemented:

- 11 :: SVC: Supervisor call: usually used in OS environments to allow
  application tasks to access system services

- 14 :: PendSV: Pendable service call; an exception usually used by an
  OS in process like context switching.

- 15 :: SYSTICK: System Tick Timer; an exception generated by a timer
  peripheral included in the NVIC (inside the ARM core).  This can be
  used by an OS or can be used as a simple timer peripheral.

In the Keil startup code, in the file =startup_stm32f10x_md.s=, these
are repectively named =SVC_Handler=, =PendSV_Handler=, and
=SysTick_Handler=.  However FreeRTOS uses the names:
- =xPortSVCHandler=
- =xPortPendSVHandler=
- =xPortSysTickHandler=

I added three #defines in =FreeRTOSConfig.h= (under the directory
=code/app/include=)

#+begin_src C
#define vPortSVCHandler     SVC_Handler     // exception #11
#define xPortPendSVHandler  PendSV_Handler  // exception #14
#define xPortSysTickHandler SysTick_Handler // exception #15
#+end_src

There was a bit of near mess-up when I failed to notice that the
/order/ of the function prototypes in FreeRTOS (=port.c=) was 14, 15,
and 11: different from the ``natural'' order.  This could end up with
erroneous code like

#+begin_src C
#define xPortPendSVHandler  SVC_Handler
#define xPortSysTickHandler PendSV_Handler
#define vPortSVCHandler     SysTick_Handler
#+end_src

This would hopefully be spotted in a code review, and in fact Jacob
Meyer spotted me making this error, despite my being aware in advance
of the problem!

** Using assertions
We talked about assertions in lect16 and watched a couple of related
videos from M. Samek.  Now I want to add working assertions to this
project.

FreeRTOS provides an assertion mechanism (used internally) via the
=configASSERT= macro.  This is described in the FreeRTOS reference
manual in §7.3 *Constants that start with ``config''* (p329 of
v10.0.0).  We are free to implement =configASSERT= if, and as, we
choose.

We might decide against linking our own error handling with that of
the kernel, and use instead something like the assertion mechanism
(qassert.h ?) from Miro Samek's QP framework, but I'll go with
=configASSERT= now and that decision can be changed later.

If I assume the system is connected to a debugger, then it's ok to
just spinlock.  I can add this macro to =FreeRTOSConfig.h=.

#+begin_src C++
#define configASSERT( x ) if( ( x ) == 0 ) \
    { taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS(); while (1) {} }
#+end_src

A more flexible technique is to call =vAssertCalled()= as shown.  Then
do some damage control, or we can store some information about how we
got there.

#+begin_src C++
void vAssertCalled( char const *filename, uint32_t line_num) {
    // damage control
    // record filename, line number, PC, LR, etc
    taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS();
    while (1) {}  // in a non-debug environment, system reset
}
#+end_src

In the above case, I would
1. In =FreeRTOSConfig.h=, redefine =configASSERT= to call the function
   =vAssertCalled()= with extra parameters.  Above this, but also in
   =FreeRTOSConfig.h=, declare =vAssertCalled()=.
2. Somewhere in my code, /implement/ =vAssertCalled=.

From the Interrupt blog, here is a good article on [[https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems][Using Asserts in
Embedded Systems]]

** Add new task, define 'race condition'
*** Race Condition: defined in Seacord2013, §7.4:

Uncontrolled concurrency can lead to non-deterministic behavior
(that is a program can exhibit different behavior for the same set
of inputs).  A /race condition/ occurs in any scenario in which two
threads can produce different behavior, depending on which thread
completes first.

Three properties are necessary for a race condition to exist:

1. /Concurrency property/: At least two control flows must be
   executing concurrently.

2. /Shared object property/: A shared race object must be accessed by
   both of the concurrent flows.

3. /Change state property/: At least one of the control flows must
   alter the state of the race object.

*** Blinking a LED on port PA8
- I've wired up my breadboard so that there's a yellow LED on port
  PA8, also known as pin D7 on the nucleo-f103rb board.
